                            Cryptocurrency has a steep learning curve, but once you get it, itâ€™s relatively easy after the fact. Sometimes, it is easier for people to understand what they are trading their money for in this space by breaking it down into various sectors and industries that are more digestible for the average investor. We have created the complete breakdown of cryptocurrencies by their functionality and the industries they intend to serve.

                            Some projects exhibit amazingly advanced technology for more efficient means of producing goods and services, while others exist as a source of liquidity for a centralized company as a way to generate revenue. The purpose of this breakdown is not to argue which reason is better for a particular coin's existence, but rather just an overview of how different industries are utilizing blockchain technology today.
