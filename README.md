This is the code for the website of the University of Alabama's Cryptocurrency Club.

This was a club that I founded at the University of Alabama in 2022 with one other student, and I grew it from the starting 2 memebers to well over 400 in the span of 18 months. We hosted weekly Monday meetings in a class-like format where the main goal of the club was to educate students about the fundamentals of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. To give resources to the students, we created a comprehensive "Crypto Crash Course" in three levels of in-depth educational material.
